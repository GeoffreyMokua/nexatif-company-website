      "BERT—which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, a Natural Language Processing technique—is an algorithm that has been added to Google Search to improve the accuracy and relevance of the search results produced. On October 21, 2019, Google officially activated BERT for English-language queries and featured snippets.",
    mainDescription:
      'BERT collaborates with previously existing Google algorithms to facilitate a clearer understanding of the searches users make by helping the system better recognize the natural language patterns people use. This enables Google Search to identify and deliver more appropriate information—results that better match the user’s input. It does not compromise or serve as a substitute for another algorithm but rather builds on the latticework foundation established by previous updates, including Fred, Possum, Mobilege, Pigeon, Hummingbird, Penguin, and Panda.',

Websites don't have to be expensive, they can be quite easy to create, and they do in fact make a huge difference in a business's growth and sustainability.",
